# U.S. Industry Productivity & Efficiency Analysis (DEA)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes productivity and efficiency across 63 U.S. industries using the U.S. KLEMS dataset. I applied input-oriented Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate how efficiently industries convert inputs into outputs. The analysis was performed under multiple returns-to-scale assumptions (CRS, VRS, IRS, DRS, FDH, ADD) to distinguish between technical inefficiency and scale inefficiency. Results were used to identify benchmark industries, peer comparisons, and opportunities for input optimization, providing insights into structural productivity differences across sectors.

## Data & Tools
